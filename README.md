JSP Tutorials
===========

John Purcell's [courses] are some of the best I've found. As a former teacher, I like to enhance my own learning by creating parallel tutorials. Here are the notes I created for John's "[Servlets and JSPs: Creating Web Applications With Java]."



##Extensive Notes
Each project has an **extensive** set of notes in the root folder of the project. For your convenience these have been copied to the *VideoNotesCopy* folder. PS: the .txt files don't render well on GitHub, they look much better in Notepad++; I'm actually mildly mortified by how their formatting has been altered when viewed through GitHub; but! it is fine for a preview :)

##WAR Files
Also, each project was compiled into a .WAR file. It is my hope that this makes it easy for you to download the projects for your own testing.

##Enhanced Learning
Lastly, it is my hope that these resources can further enhance your learning as you go through John's excellent video tutorials and help you become a master of JSPs!
