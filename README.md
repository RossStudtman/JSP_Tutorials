JSP Tutorials
===========

John Purcell's [courses] are some of the best I've found. As a former teacher, I like to enhance my own learning by creating parallel tutorials. Here are the notes, *with working code*, I created for John's "[Servlets and JSPs: Creating Web Applications With Java]."



##Extensive Notes
Each project has an **extensive** set of notes in JSP_notes folder. Note files are named to indicate which videos they cover like so: JSP_v5-10.txt -- would cover videos 5 through 10. 
2015 edits: heavily edited, much better. The last three .txt note files also saw heavy editing on line-length (they didn't look good in my tablet) - other files still have long line lengths (which is fine on a 24" monitor...). 

##WAR Files
Also, each project was compiled into a .WAR file. It is my hope that this makes it easy for you to download the projects for your own testing.

##Enhanced Learning
Lastly, it is my hope that these resources can further enhance your learning as you go through John's excellent video tutorials and help you become a master of JSPs!
